# Troubleshooting

Some tips on how to solve common issues with ReactTooltip.

import { Tooltip } from 'react-tooltip'
import 'react-tooltip/dist/react-tooltip.css'

export const TooltipAnchor = ({ children, id, ...rest }) => {
  return (
    <span
      id={id}
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        margin: 'auto',
        alignItems: 'center',
        width: '60px',
        height: '60px',
        borderRadius: '60px',
        color: '#222',
        background: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)',
        cursor: 'pointer',
        boxShadow: '3px 4px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)',
        border: '1px solid #333',
      }}
      {...rest}
    >
      {children}
    </span>
  )
}

or

```sh
yarn add react-tooltip@latest
```

If you can't find your problem here, make sure there isn't [an open issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactTooltip/react-tooltip/issues) already covering it.

## Next.js `TypeError: f is not a function`

This problem seems to be caused by a bug related to the SWC bundler used by Next.js. 
The best way to solve this is to upgrade to `next@13.3.0` or later versions.

Less ideally, if you're unable to upgrade, you can set `swcMinify: false` on your `next.config.js` file.

## Bad performance

If you're experiencing any kind of unexpected behavior or bad performance on your application when using ReactTooltip, here are a few things you can try.

### Move `<Tooltip />` on the DOM

This is specially relevant when using components that are conditionally rendered.

Always try to keep the `<Tooltip />` component rendered, so if you're having issues with a tooltip you've placed inside a component which is placed/removed from the DOM dynamically, try to move the tooltip outside of it.

We usually recommend placing the tooltip component directly inside the root component of your application (usually on `App.jsx`/`App.tsx`). You can also move the `import 'react-tooltip/dist/react-tooltip.css'` there.

### Dynamically generated anchor elements

You should avoid needlessly using a large amount of `<Tooltip />` components. One tooltip component that you use across your whole application should be good enough in most cases, but you should be fine to add a few more if you need to use different styled tooltips.

Here's a simple example on how to improve performance when using dynamically generated items.

Check the examples for the [`anchorSelect`](./examples/anchor-select) and [`render`](./examples/render) props for more complex use cases.

```jsx
// ❌ BAD
<div className="items-container">
  {
    myItems.map(({ id, content, tooltip }) => (
      <div
        key={id}
        className="item"
        data-tooltip-id={`tooltip-${id}`}
      >
        {content}
        <Tooltip id={`tooltip-${id}`} content={tooltip} />
      </div>
    ))
  }
</div>
```

```jsx
// ✅ GOOD
<div className="items-container">
  {
    myItems.map(({ id, content, tooltip }) => (
      <div
        key={id}
        className="item"
        data-tooltip-id="my-tooltip"
        data-tooltip-content={tooltip}
      >
        {content}
      </div>
    ))
  }
</div>
<Tooltip id="my-tooltip" />
```
