# Troubleshooting

Some tips on how to solve common issues with ReactTooltip.

import { Tooltip } from 'react-tooltip'

export const TooltipAnchor = ({ children, id, ...rest }) => {
  return (
    <span
      id={id}
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        margin: 'auto',
        alignItems: 'center',
        width: '60px',
        height: '60px',
        borderRadius: '60px',
        color: '#222',
        background: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)',
        cursor: 'pointer',
        boxShadow: '3px 4px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)',
        border: '1px solid #333',
      }}
      {...rest}
    >
      {children}
    </span>
  )
}

Before trying these, make sure you're running the latest ReactTooltip version with

```sh
npm install react-tooltip@latest
```

or

```sh
yarn add react-tooltip@latest
```

If you can't find your problem here, make sure there isn't [an open issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactTooltip/react-tooltip/issues) already covering it.
If there isn't, feel free to [submit a new issue here](https://github.com/ReactTooltip/react-tooltip/issues/new/choose).

## The tooltip is broken/not showing up

Make sure you've imported the default styling. You only need to do this once on your application and only if you are using a version before `5.13.0`, `App.jsx`/`App.tsx` is usually a good place to do it.

```jsx
import 'react-tooltip/dist/react-tooltip.css'
```

If you've imported the default styling and the tooltip is still not showing up when you hover on your anchor element, make sure you have content to be displayed by the tooltip.

If `data-tooltip-content` and `data-tooltip-html` are both unset (or they have empty values) on the anchor element, and also the `content`, `render`, and `children` props on the tooltip are unset (or have empty values), the tooltip is not shown by default.

## Next.js `TypeError: f is not a function`

This problem seems to be caused by a bug related to the SWC bundler used by Next.js.
The best way to solve this is to upgrade to `next@13.3.0` or later versions.

Less ideally, if you're unable to upgrade, you can set `swcMinify: false` on your `next.config.js` file.

## Next.js `"use client"` error

This normally happens when you use `react-tooltip` inside a component that is not tagged as client component. For more info, see the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components).

To use `react-tooltip` on Next.js 13 without having to tag your component or page as a client component, just create a new file `ReactTooltip.tsx` (for this example, the file path is `src/components/ReactTooltip.tsx`) and place the following code inside of the created file:

:::caution

Avoid naming the file `react-tooltip.tsx` (or with whichever extension your project uses), since it may interfere with your editor's autocomplete funcionality.

:::

```jsx
// src/components/ReactTooltip.tsx
'use client'

export * from 'react-tooltip'
```

And in the place that you are importing React Tooltip:

```jsx
// ❌ Old
import { Tooltip } from 'react-tooltip'
```

```jsx
// ✅ New
import { Tooltip } from 'components/react-tooltip'
```

## Bad performance

If you're experiencing any kind of unexpected behavior or bad performance on your application when using ReactTooltip, here are a few things you can try.

### Move `<Tooltip />` on the DOM

This is specially relevant when using components that are conditionally rendered.

Always try to keep the `<Tooltip />` component rendered, so if you're having issues with a tooltip you've placed inside a component which is placed/removed from the DOM dynamically, try to move the tooltip outside of it.

We usually recommend placing the tooltip component directly inside the root component of your application (usually on `App.jsx`/`App.tsx`).

### Dynamically generated anchor elements

You should avoid needlessly using a large amount of `<Tooltip />` components. One tooltip component that you use across your whole application should be good enough in most cases, but you should be fine to add a few more if you need to use different styled tooltips.

Here's a simple example on how to improve performance when using dynamically generated items.

:::info

Check the examples for the [`anchorSelect`](./examples/anchor-select) and [`render`](./examples/render) props for more complex use cases.

:::

```jsx
// ❌ BAD
<div className="items-container">
  {myItems.map(({ id, content, tooltip }) => (
    <div key={id} className="item" data-tooltip-id={`tooltip-${id}`}>
      {content}
      <Tooltip id={`tooltip-${id}`} content={tooltip} />
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

```jsx
// ✅ GOOD
<div className="items-container">
  {
    myItems.map(({ id, content, tooltip }) => (
      <div
        key={id}
        className="item"
        data-tooltip-id="my-tooltip"
        data-tooltip-content={tooltip}
      >
        {content}
      </div>
    ))
  }
</div>
<Tooltip id="my-tooltip" />
```
