This doc needs help! Please submit your PR...

## Building a fork locally
Preconditions: 
* npm installed and available on path
* unix make is on path (for windows: install cygwin including make, add to path)

* Clone the git repository
* Install Dependencies: `npm install`
* Run the build: `npm run build`
* If you want to see the examples, start the examples: `npm run start` and open URL http://localhost:8888 in a Browser

## Commit messages

We are using semantic-release to automate the release process, and this depends on a specific format for commit messages. Please run `npm run commit` to use `commitizen` to properly format your commit messages so they can be automatically processed and included in release notes.

## Pull request testing

Some notes on testing and releasing.
* For a PR, follow Github's command-line instructions for retrieving the branch with the changes.
* `make dev` starts a development server, open `http://localhost:8888` to see the example website.
* Provide feedback on the PR about your results.

## Doing a release

We are using semantic-release instead of this:

* `make deploy` updates the files in the `standalone` directory
* update the version number in `package.json`
    - Fixes update the patch number, features update the minor number.
    - Major version update is reserved for API breaking changes, not just additions. 
* `npm run github-changes -- -n 3.X.Y` to update the changelog
* `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` to get the version to master.
* `git tag -a 3.X.Y -m 3.X.Y` `git push --tags`
* `npm publish`
* add a version on the github release page, based on the tag
